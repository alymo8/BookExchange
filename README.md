# BookXchange

This is a project I worked on, it enables users to view, list and borrow books.
In this project, we focused on developing the back end using the Model-View-Controller pattern in Java.
This is a Full stack software engineering project. We have used the following tech stack:
Back end: Java, Spring Boot, and Hibernate
Front end: React
Cloud and DB: Heroku
